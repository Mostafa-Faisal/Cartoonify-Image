# Cartoonify Image

Welcome to the **Cartoonify Image** project! This repository contains a Python-based application that transforms images into cartoon-like representations using computer vision techniques. The goal of this project is to provide a fun and creative way to process images.

## Features

- **Image Cartoonification**: Convert any image into a cartoon-style version.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple and intuitive usage.
- **Python-Powered**: Built entirely in Python, leveraging powerful libraries for image processing.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (see below)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mostafa-Faisal/Cartoonify-Image.git
   cd Cartoonify-Image
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python cartoonify.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Place your images in the appropriate folder or specify the image path when prompted.
2. Run the script to process the image and generate a cartoonified version.
3. The output will be saved in a designated folder or displayed based on the script's configuration.

## Technologies Used
